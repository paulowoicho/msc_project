# MSc Project
This project explores content understanding from open domain podcasts and audio. The project is done as part of the TREC 2020 Podcasts Track.

### Requirements
Auto-generated summaries should be short enough to be read on a smartphone screen (and shorter than the creator provided description), but provide enough information for a user to decide whether a podcast is worth a listen.
